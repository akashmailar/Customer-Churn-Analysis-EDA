# Customer-Churn-Analysis-EDA

## Objective:
The analysis explores customer churn patterns, focusing on various factors such as payment  methods, contract types, tenure, and demographic attributes. The goal is to identify which  factors are most strongly associated with higher churn rates to guide customer retention  strategies.

## Key Insights:
- **Contract Type**: Customers on month-to-month contracts show a higher tendency to churn compared to those on yearly or bi-annual contracts. This suggests that long-term contracts may improve customer retention.
  
- **PaymentMethods**: A significant proportion of customers using electronic checks are more likely to churn compared to those using other payment methods (credit cards, bank transfers, etc.). This could be due convenience or trust issues associated with electronic check payments.

## Churn Rate by Tenure:
- Customers with shorter tenure (less than one year) are more likely to churn, indicating the criticality of initial engagement strategies.

## Visualizations:
- The visualizations, including bar plots and line graphs, highlight the disparity in churn rates by different contract types and payment methods. They also show trends over customer tenure, supporting the need for personalized retention strategies.
